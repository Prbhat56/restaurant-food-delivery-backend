Restaurant Food Delivery Backend

A robust backend solution for a restaurant food delivery application.

Description

This project serves as the backend for a restaurant food delivery system, utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure clean, maintainable, and testable code. The backend is designed to handle various operations efficiently, including order management, user authentication, menu handling, and delivery tracking. It also incorporates advanced authentication mechanisms, including OAuth for secure user sign-ins and API integrations, offering a high level of security and user privacy.

Features

Authentication: OAuth implementation for secure user authentication and third-party API integrations.

Order Management: Efficient handling of food orders, including real-time status updates.

Menu Management: Easy management of restaurant menus, categories, and items.

Delivery Tracking: Real-time tracking of food delivery for enhanced customer experience.

Scalable API Design: RESTful APIs designed for seamless integration with mobile and web clients.

Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Node.js (primary backend language)
